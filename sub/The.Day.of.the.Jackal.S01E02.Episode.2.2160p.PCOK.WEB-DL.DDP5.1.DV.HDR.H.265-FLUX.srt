00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:14,535
<i>The populist politician Manfred Fest</i>

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,960
<i>was struck by a sniper in Munich.</i>

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,759
<i>Fest was visiting his son, Elias Fest</i>

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,800
<i>at the Saint Elizabeth hospital.</i>

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,240
Argh!

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,559
<i>This has sparked speculation</i>

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,359
<i>concerning a connection
between these incidents.</i>

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,999
When a sniper finds a rifle

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,319
that allows him to make
a shot at that distance,

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,919
that rifle is a keeper.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,199
There's a gun maker
who's been trying to do this.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,999
His name is Norman Stoke.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,839
I have an asset in Belfast.
Codename Sparrow.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,159
If Larry knew who I was talking to,
he'd kill me.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,079
- She has a daughter, Emma.
- Whose streets?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,600
- I know I can find him.
- Don't let me down.

17
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,680
Who's the target?

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,124
Ulle Dag Charles.

19
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,483
River is a revolutionary technology.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,565
Can you get to him?

21
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,125
It'll cost.

22
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:06,880
We've got a serious problem
with your student.

23
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,605
She's arrested.

<i>In Germany, supporters of Manfred Fest</i>

47
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:20,680
<i>continue to call for the upcoming
federal elections to be postponed.</i>

48
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,462
<i>His political opponents deny that
their resistance to this</i>

49
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,640
<i>...is a mark of disrespect
to Fest and his family.</i>

50
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:29,092
<i>Manfred Fest's son, Elias was also...</i>

51
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:31,080
Who's Sparrow?

52
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:36,639
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,679
- Alison, just give me a moment.
- Morning.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,880
<i>You're a fucking bitch, you know that?</i>

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,116
Alison, what's going on?

56
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:46,556
<i>Don't tell me this is a coincidence.</i>

57
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:50,316
You suddenly turning up out the blue
and next thing Emma's arrested.

58
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,780
'They're not letting me speak to her.

59
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,040
<i>And I know you're
doing this to get at me.</i>

60
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,160
I've got nothing to do with it.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,660
<i>You're a liar.</i>

62
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:03,156
Why are you calling me, Alison?

63
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:06,160
<i>You know fucking fine rightly
why I'm calling.</i>

64
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,477
I know you can get her out.

65
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,703
You got me out.

66
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:14,157
Yeah, you had
something to offer back then.

67
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:23,156
Just get me Norman's phone number,
and I'll do the rest.

68
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,117
<i>And I want it today.</i>

69
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,280
The preliminary report says Emma
had a preexisting heart condition.

70
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,999
She could've died anywhere.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,580
But she died in a police cell,
and you put her there.

72
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:50,080
The man who killed Manfred Fest

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,119
will kill again, unless we stop him.

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,959
So, collateral damage?

75
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,780
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- What way would you put it?

76
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:01,240
A girl died who shouldn't have died.

77
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:20,079
This is Mr Carver.
He cleans up messes for us.

78
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,860
And you're very lucky
he's here to clean up yours.

79
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,159
The girl was in police custody.

80
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,159
That makes the police
legally responsible,

81
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,080
but it is my job to make certain,

82
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,460
one hundred percent,

83
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,840
that MI6 can't be connected in any way.

84
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:42,300
So, who knows you were
at the police station?

85
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:50,279
Everything went through Gillespie.

86
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,300
- The copper?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,120
He's the only one
who even knows my name.

88
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
I'll have a word with Gillespie,

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,557
make sure no one else can identify her.

90
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,560
- Anyone else?
- No.

91
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,916
- You're sure?
- Yes.

92
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:07,860
Let's hope Gillespie can be trusted.

93
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,039
We need to
close this operation down, now.

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,359
I spoke to Sparrow this morning.
She's on the hook.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,477
Did you tell her that
her daughter's dead?!

96
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,640
I did not.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,879
You're in a hole
and you want to keep digging?

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,679
A major political figure
has been assassinated,

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
and there's a strong probability
that the gun was

100
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,517
made by a British gunmaker,
and I have a lead on him.

101
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,772
Are you saying we should
just walk away?

102
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:40,280
This is a wild goose chase, and it's
not helping our department's reputation.

103
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,957
We should offload this
to the Central Europe desk.

104
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:51,317
I promised the Germans we'd help.

105
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:58,316
Emma's... is unfortunate,

106
00:07:58,317 --> 00:07:59,900
but it's ends and means.

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,520
And in this instance, ends trump.

108
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:08,360
Alison cannot find out about Emma.

109
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,437
Once that news breaks, I've lost her.

110
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,276
I can buy you some time.

111
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,140
How long?

112
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,340
Twenty-four hours maybe.

113
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,860
You'd better get to work.

114
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,503
Come on.

115
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,360
<i>Yes?</i>

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,476
I've got some good news.

117
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:39,800
<i>I've talked to my bosses,
and I can get Emma out.</i>

118
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,436
- <i>Great, right?</i>
- Yes.

119
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:46,160
But I need you to get me Norman's
phone number, and I need it today.

120
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't worry, Emma'll be home soon.

121
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,700
Morning.

122
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:05,977
Hmm. I can see when you are...

123
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:13,340
When you go to that place you go
when you are thinking about work.

124
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:15,260
I'm here.

125
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,420
Only half.

126
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,700
Tell the other half to come.

127
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,300
I miss him.

128
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,877
There's someone
I've been working with, has, um...

129
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:35,477
Well, they've misunderstood
their obligations to me.

130
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,060
Is it money?

131
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:40,460
Yeah.

132
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,540
A lot?

133
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:44,020
Yeah.

134
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,780
What are you gonna do?

135
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,279
It's not just the money.

136
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,420
It's that if it were to get out
that someone had...

137
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:04,860
...got away without paying me,
it, it hurts the brand.

138
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:07,180
Which is a problem.

139
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:08,620
I know.

140
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,340
And if he steals from you...

141
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,060
...he steals from your family,

142
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,517
which is me and Carlito.

143
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:21,016
So you tell me where he lives,
and I get the money he owes.

144
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,420
What?

145
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,277
- I will do it, trust me.
- Yeah, I don't fucking doubt it.

146
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,040
I do not doubt that.

147
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,180
But don't worry, I'll sort it.

148
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,380
There's another deal brewing.

149
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,300
Is it big?

150
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:45,317
Well, it would mean that I could
spend a lot more time with you two.

151
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:51,476
The people you work for think that,

152
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,700
because they pay you
a lot of money, they...

153
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,060
...own your soul.

154
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,420
What is that look?

155
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,700
What?

156
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,940
- Sometimes you look at me and...
- What?

157
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,037
I don't know.

158
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:15,600
No, what do you mean?
Sometimes you look at me?

159
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
- And... what do you mean?
- I don't know.

160
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,860
Sometimes you look at me and what?

161
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,240
What do you see?

162
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:29,119
- I see a motherfucker.
- Fuck you.

163
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:24,020
I was shaving this morning,

164
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:25,740
and it hit me.

165
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,940
The economists are wrong.

166
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,003
We could easily lose
half the world's population

167
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,123
and there'd be no downside.

168
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,203
Would have to be the right half,
of course.

169
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:43,618
Now, the question is, can we trust
the man who killed Manfred Fest?

170
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:47,295
Leonora asked me to find you the
best. That's what I've done.

171
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,923
He's clearly capable,

172
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:51,441
but a hundred mil is
a hell of a lot of money to spend.

173
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,575
Well, we only pay if he delivers.

174
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,020
And if he delivers, it'll be worth it.

175
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,920
Thank you. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming in.

176
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,239
Ulle Dag Charles, you're about
to launch a product, River,

177
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,980
which you're promising will deliver
global economic justice.

178
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,479
Why is the richest man on the planet
so interested in economic justice?

179
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,780
Well, we should all be
interested in economic justice.

180
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,380
It's a simple as that. Right?

181
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,760
Your parents were leftist radicals.

182
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,679
Some would say you're
trying to please mom and dad.

183
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,879
Oh, come on.

184
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,755
Look, money runs like water

185
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,560
into the pockets of the superrich

186
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,060
and stays there.

187
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,479
Instead it should run into
reservoirs for future generations.

188
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,839
And the only way to do that

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,920
is total financial transparency.

190
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,940
Right?

191
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,120
Super-rich like you?

192
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,940
Yeah.

193
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Do you want everyone
to see into your bank accounts?

194
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,960
Well, I've got nothing to hide.

195
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,340
But there are people out there,

196
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,640
with a lot to hide,

197
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,180
and River is gonna...

198
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,559
We have very little time.

199
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,300
This has got to be done
before he releases this River thing.

200
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,600
Do I make myself clear?

201
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,139
♪ Happy birthday to you

202
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,940
♪ Happy birthday to you

203
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,980
♪ Happy birthday

204
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,640
♪ Carlitos!

205
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,639
♪ Happy Birthday to you!

206
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,165
Shall we do this? Let's have a go.
Blow the candles out!

207
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:51,039
Come on, Carlito!

208
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,125
Well done!

209
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,200
Presents!

210
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,924
Presents! Presents! Presents!

211
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,000
Carlito, all these presents for you!

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Do you want to give him this one?

213
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,799
I actually... I made you something,
little one.

214
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,924
- You did?
- Yeah, in New York.

215
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,605
- Did you have time for this?
- Yeah.

216
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,119
Look, look, look!

217
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,279
Shall we have a look?

218
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,540
What's this?

219
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,140
Look at this, Carlitos.

220
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,200
Look!

221
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,320
This...

222
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,980
...Little one,
this is an American plane.

223
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,960
Daddy, no, don't...

224
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:34,924
Hey.

225
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,240
Guys, no posting, you know.

226
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:38,460
Mama?

227
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:40,205
OK, OK.

228
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,540
They know.

229
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,340
- I promise, they know.
- Sorry, I know you know.

230
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:49,320
- You know.
- I know.

231
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,000
- What?
- Happy birthday.

232
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,504
You alright, love?

233
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:26,379
I can't bear to think of Em
all alone in a cell.

234
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,140
Aye...

235
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,411
...And over there in London.

236
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:39,340
At least if they were holding her
here, she'd be with her own people.

237
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:45,420
Love...

238
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,940
We've both been through this.

239
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:53,279
The first time they arrested me,
they had me petrified.

240
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,820
But you survived.

241
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,620
She's not like us, Larry.
She needs us there.

242
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,460
I wanna go over.

243
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Where we gonna get the money for that?

244
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:08,600
- You could ask Norman?
- Norman?

245
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,280
Well, Norman has loads of money.

246
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:14,500
You're in touch with him, aren't ya?

247
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,484
- Do you know where he is?
- I can't run to my wee brother

248
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,560
every time we get in trouble.

249
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,740
This is serious. They're saying
she bottled a policewoman.

250
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,180
She needs us over there!

251
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,220
Charles.

252
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,380
Hi.

253
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,060
No pain.

254
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,520
- A lot of children, eh?
- Always. Always children.

255
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Different for you, no? You...

256
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,785
- ...you only child?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,040
- Sorry. Sorry, um...
- No.

258
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,288
You know, Charlie,
my... my English is very difficult.

259
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,803
You always say that, Alvaro,
but you speak very good English.

260
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:15,830
- Nah.
- No, it's...

261
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,360
Spanish is impossible for me...

262
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,923
- ...so it's all good...
- No! Your Spanish is better.

263
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,068
- Really?
- Mm.

264
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:24,385
You know, I never tell you.

265
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,185
Always when you go away,

266
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,200
I tell everybody,

267
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:31,640
don't worry. I here.

268
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:35,620
I look, everything is perfect,
everything is OK.

269
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:39,215
- So... you need anything...
- Yeah.

270
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,095
- I can do.
- That's very kind, Alvero,

271
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,825
and I appreciate it. Honestly.

272
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,700
Look, Charlie. One thing.

273
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,288
- I have a friend, OK?
- OK.

274
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,320
And my friend has a... has a bar.

275
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,100
And he offered to...

276
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,200
How do you say...

277
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,020
- To, to sell, to sell.
- Yeah.

278
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,900
A part, half of the bar.

279
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:04,105
OK.

280
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,065
So, if you're interested,

281
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,824
I can take you to my friend,

282
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,975
and the three can speak,
see if it's good.

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,935
I think that would be...
I think we should do that.

284
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,465
But I think maybe when I...

285
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:17,820
...perhaps when I come back.

286
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,824
- Here?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,175
Do you know what?
Give me one, one second.

288
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,705
I've just gotta make a quick call.

289
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,720
Yeah, I gotta... Er, it will be quick.

290
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:42,373
I'll be one minute.

291
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:44,600
Yeah.

292
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,800
- No. Not again, please.
- I'm so sorry.

293
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:38,495
- Oh, come on.
- I know.

294
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,375
They know it's his birthday. They
just have no empathy, these people.

295
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,799
- I'm so sorry.
- You arrived only yesterday.

296
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,399
I know, I know I did.

297
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,559
Guys, I'm so sorry,
I'm gonna have to head off.

298
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,879
Bye, bye little one. Bye, bye.

299
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,999
Happy birthday.

300
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
I love you. I'll see you soon.
I'll see you soon.

301
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,855
- Ciao.
- OK, I'm driving you.

302
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,200
No, I booked a cab.

303
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,840
- You can't leave this.
- No, I'm driving you.

304
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,080
Charlie.

305
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,252
Hey, I here, OK?

306
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah. Thanks, Alvaro.

307
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Bye, guys.

308
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,959
- Bye! Adios!
- Ciao!

309
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
- Bye!
- Say bye, Daddy!

310
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,240
The BND said the guard was convinced
he was talking to the real Ralf.

311
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,180
The voice, the intonation, the sarcasm.

312
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,520
Apparently, everything was perfect.

313
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,280
So our man is a mimic.

314
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,215
And if he's a mimic,
he's good with language,

315
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,440
so he's not necessarily German.

316
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,020
Er, enlarge the backpack for me?

317
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,720
Waxed canvas.

318
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,639
Of course
he's taken the maker's tab off.

319
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,620
Enhance that so I can see where it was.

320
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah. Grab some screenshots of that.

321
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,639
Done. Shall I move on?

322
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,900
Yeah.

323
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:32,060
So he's righthanded...

324
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,100
Oh whoa, stop it there.

325
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,180
Enlarge.

326
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,640
Keep going.

327
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,239
Keep going.

328
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,100
Whoa stop, stop, stop.

329
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,960
Browning HiPower. Mark III.

330
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:50,559
Why would you go for a nine mil

331
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,319
when you could have something
with a lot more stopping power?

332
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,000
Why would you do that?

333
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:14,740
That's it?

334
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,820
You've gone to that place again.

335
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,519
- Oh my God.
- I'm here.

336
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,860
I'm here.

337
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:29,540
Yeah.

338
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,646
Don't humiliate me.

339
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,420
I love you.

340
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,860
I love you, too.

341
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
- Hola.
- How are you?

342
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,560
- OK.

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,639
<i>Hi, this is Charles.</i>

359
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,040
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

360
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,520
There you go, love.

361
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,580
Larry, please. Call Norman.

362
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,820
I've called him already.

363
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,860
Twice.

364
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:50,780
If he doesn't call back soon,
I'll try him again, OK?

365
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,608
The maker's tab was
a sort of mountain range shape.

366
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:06,380
She...

367
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:15,967
Hello, yes. I'm looking for a very
specific backpack.

368
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,688
Charcoal grey, wax canvas.

369
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,260
Mountain range maker's tab.

370
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:25,328
Isabel's expecting you.

371
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:35,007
The sniper's British.

372
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:36,447
Don't even joke about that.

373
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,007
- And he's probably ex-British Army.
- You know that how?

374
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:43,816
You need military training to make
a shot at even half that distance.

375
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,015
Doesn't necessarily mean
he's one of ours.

376
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,079
He used a Browning HiPower
Mark III to kill Elias's bodyguard

377
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,220
and to wound Elias.

378
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,320
The HiPower was standard
British Army issue until 2013.

379
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,460
A lot of armed forces used the HiPower.

380
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,239
He had a backpack made by
a small UKbased startup

381
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,079
called The Perfect Pack.

382
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,639
The backpack went on sale
eight months ago.

383
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,655
There are only two retailers,
both in Leeds,

384
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,580
and neither ships internationally.

385
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,160
That means he was here, in the UK.

386
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,439
Or an accomplice picked it up for him.

387
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,240
No. Our man works alone.

388
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,039
Snipers work with a spotter.

389
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,679
Not this one.
He was alone when he shot Elias

390
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,660
and he was alone
when he left the apartment building.

391
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,820
So we think the sniper is British,
and the gun maker is British.

392
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,919
- Have you heard from Sparrow?
- She knows what she has to do.

393
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,800
By tomorrow morning she'll know
her daughter's dead,

394
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,520
and bang goes your leverage.

395
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,619
- I need more time.
- No.

396
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,039
I'm this close.

397
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,880
Bianca... we're already
on very thin ice.

398
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:55,686
I suggest you encourage Sparrow
to give you what you want.

399
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,700
By tomorrow.

400
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:11,433
Hello, my love.

401
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:12,960
<i>What time are you gonna be home?</i>

402
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:15,999
Err, not sure. Not too late, I hope.

403
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,160
<i>OK, OK.
My brothers are coming at eight.</i>

404
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm cooking moussaka.

405
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,959
It's so complicated, though.
They better love it.

406
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,639
They will. Um, OK. I'll see you then.

407
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,079
OK, don't be late. Yep. Alright.

408
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,424
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

409
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,640
OK.

410
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,239
If our sniper was ex-Army,

411
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,999
he would've done his sniper training

412
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,719
at Pirbright if he was a Para
or Household Division.

413
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,919
If he had another cap badge
he would've gone to

414
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,360
the Infantry Battle School at Brecon.

415
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,399
We need them to go
through their records.

416
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,479
And what are we looking for?

417
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,359
An exceptional candidate.

418
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,079
Righthanded. Tall. White.

419
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,319
And how far back do we want them to go?

420
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
Assuming our man is under fifty...

421
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,840
I'd say about thirty years.

422
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,140
Who is this?

423
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,293
<i>We met in Sweden.</i>

424
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:28,139
<i>How can I help' you?</i>

425
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,120
I have spoken to my colleagues, and
we feel there's a deal to be done.

426
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:34,893
But we need to meet in person
to work out the details.

427
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,800
<i>We're not meeting again.</i>

428
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,199
For a deal of this size,
we believe a meeting is essential.

429
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,799
It has to be in person and it has to
be in the next fortyeight hours.

430
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,920
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid that's not happening.

431
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:51,960
We've already shown you
a million dollars of good faith.

432
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,720
If we can't meet in the next 48
hours, we'll have to move on.

433
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,400
<i>Hello?</i>

434
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
<i>Hello?</i>

435
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:10,319
You'll have to come to me.
<i>I'll send instructions.</i>

436
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,726
I look forward to it.

437
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,058
- Hi!
- Oh, hey.

438
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,375
Oh, just about on time.

439
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,920
This looks great!

440
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,119
Oh wow, OK, OK. OK, OK.

441
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,679
Er, Tempranillo, perfect for moussaka.

442
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,679
- Grenache blanc. This is perfect.
- Yeah, see, I do listen to you.

443
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,800
Or they told her at the wine shop.

444
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,060
Oh wow.
She's never that excited to see me.

445
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,295
- Hey.
- Hello.

446
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,079
- You good?
- I wasn't sure which one.

447
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,279
- It's absolutely good.
- Dad.

448
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,040
Absolutely fine.
Come on, bring it in. There he is.

449
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,640
- You alright?
- Mum sends love.

450
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:51,916
Good to see you, man.

451
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:53,359
- I'm good, man. You alright?
- Hi.

452
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,680
- Good to see you.
- Looking good, looking good.

453
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,540
- You good?
- Hi!

454
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,080
How are you?

455
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,400
- I'm good, you?
- Yeah.

456
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
I wanted a Bacardi and Coke.

457
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,280
- You asked for a Gin.
- I asked for a Bacardi.

458
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:32,120
And get a pack of crisps
while you're at it.

459
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,340
Aye.

460
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:18,986
Second time lucky.

461
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,246
Vodka and Coke.

462
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:31,920
Gin and Coke?

463
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:34,171
You're not funny, Larry.

464
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,759
Do you like it?

465
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,039
You see the gods
on Mount Olympus, yeah,

466
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,920
they used to eat this thing
called ambrosia.

467
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,919
But then Jasmine goes and sends them
up some of her famous moussaka.

468
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,080
- You know what they said?
- No.

469
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,460
You don't know what they said?

470
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:57,277
They said, Fuck ambrosia.

471
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:59,520
Because from now on
its Jasmine's moussaka.

472
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,114
- Oh, god.
- What is he talking about?

473
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,118
- It's a brainy compliment.
- I can see that the classics

474
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,800
- aren't wasted on you, Adam.
- Come on.

475
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,835
Mm-hmm.

476
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,280
One second.

477
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,740
Uh... top up?

478
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,040
<i>Please give characters two,
three and six of your telephone ID.</i>

479
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,300
Zero, one, nine.

480
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,559
<i>How I can help?</i>

481
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,120
I need a priority location on a phone.

482
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:47,000
- Speaking as a former teenage boy...
- A very long time ago.

483
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,119
Mm-hmm, that's what we do.
We fuck it up. That is true.

484
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,160
- It's facts.
- It's facts.

485
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:02,200
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

486
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,620
I'm sorry.

487
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,260
I'm sorry, Jas.

488
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,580
Um, I'll see you soon, boys.

489
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,140
Er, call us when you get there, yeah?

490
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:16,606
I'll try.

491
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,340
Ms Jansone? This has been left for you.

492
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,260
Thank you.

493
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:53,799
Norman's still at
the location in Belarus.

494
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,200
I have nine missed calls from Sparrow.

495
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,799
Does she know about Emma?

496
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,280
<i>Not yet.</i>

497
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:01,894
<i>But at some point soon
she's going to have to be told.</i>

498
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:05,199
If Sparrow finds out, she'll tell
Larry, who will tell his brother.

499
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,960
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

500
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:10,980
Spencer's waiting in arrivals.
He'll get you across the border.

501
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,700
Just make sure you get Norman.

502
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,100
- <i>We're counting on you.</i>
- Yeah.

503
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:20,649
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

504
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,740
This way.

505
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,119
The Latvians know we're
operating on their turf.

506
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,020
They're friendly,
but Belarus is very hostile.

507
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,279
We need to get to the target
as soon as possible.

508
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,400
The journey to Smarhon's six hours.
Toby's our wheels.

509
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,220
Colin'll be with us for the grab.

510
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,860
Let's go.

511
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,980
You can keep looking straight ahead.

512
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:07,260
Have you left your phone at the hotel?

513
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,880
Of course.

514
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,980
Good.

515
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,367
My clients need to know
if you think it's possible,

516
00:42:13,368 --> 00:42:15,140
speaking as a professional?

517
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,540
Well, er, UDC may think he's God,
but that doesn't mean he's immortal.

518
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,860
We're still some way apart on the fee.

519
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,540
Perhaps we can meet in the middle?

520
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,246
We're not terrorists,

521
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,566
You know, we're patriots.
We're defending our way of life.

522
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,800
I have fuck all interest in
why you want him dead.

523
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,247
A hundred million is a big ask.

524
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,087
You're paying me to kill him.

525
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,487
I am charging you for getting away.

526
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,935
And, speaking as a professional,

527
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,260
getting away
is an important consideration.

528
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,287
It's half in advance, half on delivery.

529
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,320
No. Half up front won't fly, but

530
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:57,575
I am authorised to pay you
a commencement fee

531
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,819
of twenty million dollars.

532
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:02,240
I could do that today.

533
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,220
Would that be acceptable?

534
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,660
Yeah.

535
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:17,455
The job has to be
completed by the 28th.

536
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,415
I'm not in the habit of being hurried.

537
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,319
UDC releases River on the 28th.
It's nonnegotiable.

538
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,440
Can you do it?

539
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,780
Once the payment is in my bank
account, I will get to work.

540
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,460
Why are you still in Munich?

541
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,120
It's been nearly a week
since you killed Manfred Fest.

542
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,019
Have you loose ends to tie up?

543
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,500
We don't want you doing anything
that attracts attention or

544
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,839
that puts you in jeopardy
that's not in service of the job.

545
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,560
There are no loose ends.

546
00:43:57,306 --> 00:43:58,466
Good.

547
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,940
Then we have a deal.

548
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,060
We have a deal.

549
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,940
Keep looking straight ahead.

550
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,940
In future communications...

551
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,740
...we'll use the code name
Rodin for the target.

552
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,380
Rodin.

553
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,359
Very good.

554
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,960
And we'll need a code name
for you, too.

555
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,666
Why not the Jackal?

556
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,620
Why not?

557
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,679
Sir, thank you so much
for your patience.

558
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,039
Mr. Thirsk. So that payment was
made from a company account.

559
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,520
HelleLinie.

560
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:29,479
HelleLinie. Well,

561
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,820
what can you tell me about HelleLinie?

562
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,759
I'm afraid we're not authorised
to give out that information,

563
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,380
but the national company register
is available online.

564
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,199
Is there anything else I
can help you with?

565
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,220
Er, no, thank you.

566
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:37,160
Twenty minutes to the border.

567
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,879
Norman hasn't moved.

568
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,260
40 meters out at the rear. Moving.

569
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,980
Moving.

570
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:43,420
25 meters out at the rear. Moving.

571
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:47,380
Moving.

572
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,040
<i>Approaching front door. Moving.</i>

573
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,780
Moving.

574
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,200
10 meters out at the rear. Moving.

575
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,860
Everyone in position?

576
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,620
Two in position.

577
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:28,319
Norman! The house is surrounded!

578
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,000
Throw your weapons down
and come outside!

579
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,719
On my count.

580
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,919
Three, two, one... breech!

581
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:52,740
Man down!

582
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,180
Fuck.

583
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,839
We're two down.
Target escaping on foot.

584
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,200
In pursuit.

585
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,560
Fuck!

586
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,500
Bravo to Tango. We were
set up. He knew we were coming.

587
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,119
Two pax down.
Immediate extraction from X=Ray now.
