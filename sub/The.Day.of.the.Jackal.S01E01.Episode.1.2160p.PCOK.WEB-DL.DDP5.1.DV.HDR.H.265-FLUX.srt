<i>...a connection
between these incidents,</i>

166
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,959
<i>forming a broader conspiracy
against the Fest family.</i>

167
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,880
- Passport.
- Ja.

168
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,919
Do you know, this is the first time
that I've ever been asked

169
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,080
for a passport crossing
between Germany and France.

170
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,279
- Where are you coming from?
- Er, Nuremberg.

171
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,279
Do you live in Nuremberg?

172
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,759
- Er, no, I live in Paris.
- What were you doing in Nuremberg?

173
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,200
I was visiting someone on business.

174
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,800
- Is this your car?
- No, it's a rental.

175
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,120
Open the boot.

176
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,180
Open it, please.

177
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,479
What's happening here?

178
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,260
Nothing to worry about.

179
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,719
What's in the box?

180
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,060
Ah, so this...

181
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,860
is why I was in Nuremberg.

182
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,900
This...

183
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,220
is a Jaques set.

184
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,140
The ivory is all pre-ban.

185
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,439
And it's, er... it's incredibly rare.

186
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,420
I collect these things.

187
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,740
Wait here.

188
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,920
- You can go.
- Thank you very much.

189
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,220
Have a great evening.

190
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,940
Thank you.

191
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,759

What's the latest on the Fest shooting?

207
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,279
Er, the report's
literally just come in.

208
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,799
Should be on your screen now.

209
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,580
Single shot to the head.
A lot of splatter.

210
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,599
Bloody good shot.

211
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,540
- No, that can't be right.
- What?

212
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,079
3,815 metres.

213
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,860
But that... that's not possible.

214
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,879
Well, it's what the Germans are saying.

215
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,660
And we know how precise
the Germans are.

216
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,319
- What's-What's going on?
- They've called a meeting about it.

217
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,680
Osi. Osi.

218
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,319
I should be at the Fest meeting.

219
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,559
- You'll get a full briefing afterwards.
- No, no, no, no.

220
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,239
I don't want a full briefing.
Snipers is my patch.

221
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,879
- I didn't draw up the names, Bianca.
- Well, wait, wait, wait.

222
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,919
- Who did? Was it Isabel?
- I assume so.

223
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,039
Well... Look. Jordan's in there.

224
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,080
Jordan.
What does Jordan know about snipers?

225
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:05,507
I have to be in there.

226
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
Who is that anyway?

227
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,000
Werner Leckner, German Intelligence.

228
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,439
<i>Last night there were arson attacks</i>

229
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,799
<i>on mosques in Hamburg,
Berlin and Dresden.</i>

230
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,359
And there's been rioting
in different parts of the country.

231
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
It's obviously very alarming, Werner.

232
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,639
And as you know, the Foreign Secretary

233
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,360
was a personal friend of the Fest
family. He's very shocked.

234
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,599
As are we all.
What do you need from us?

235
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,359
We are not making any assumptions

236
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,280
about the nationality of the sniper,

237
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,759
so we are reaching out to all

238
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,719
our international partners
for assistance.

239
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,279
There's been a lot of speculation
about the shot.

240
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Do you have a confirmed distance?

241
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,580
Yes, indeed, um...

242
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,319
From the apartment block
where the shot was taken

243
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,919
to the hospital door
where Fest was hit is,

244
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,759
er... 3,815 metres.

245
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,460
Are you sure about that?

246
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,399
Because the world record for
a confirmed kill with a sniper rifle

247
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,160
is 3,540 metres.

248
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,599
Ukraine, 2023.

249
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,706
- Did you retrieve the weapon?
- No.

250
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,679
Right, so the sniper took it with him.

251
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,959
This is the suspect leaving
the apartment building,

252
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,839
two minutes and 52 seconds
after the shot was fired.

253
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,000
But... er, sorry, where's the rifle?

254
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,159
He broke it down and put it
in the bag. Obviously.

255
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,640
Can we get dimensions, please?

256
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,599
The bag is less
than 60 centimetres tall.

257
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,520
- So?
- The Tac-50 barrel is 737 millimetres

258
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,039
and it's the shortest around
in this category.

259
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,280
The Denel barrel is a full metre long.

260
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,679
The... the... the rifle's
not in the bag.

261
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,079
If it was in the bag,
we'd see the barrel poking out.

262
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,639
He left it behind.

263
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,440
No, forensics found no trace
of a weapon at the scene.

264
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,039
When a sniper finds a rifle,

265
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,639
one that allows him
to make a shot at that distance,

266
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,599
that rifle is a keeper.

267
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,040
He's never going to leave it behind.

268
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,839
Which means he took it with him.

269
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,680
And if he took it with him,
then it has to be in that bag.

270
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,380
I'm not following, Bianca.

271
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,420
You said the bag isn't big enough?

272
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,580
Which means the rifle is bespoke.

273
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,439
- The barrel came in two parts.
- A...

274
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,520
barrel in two parts is
the gunmaker's holy grail.

275
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,199
If the rifling were out
the tiniest fraction,

276
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,559
it would compromise the shot.
It's impossible.

277
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,599
There's a gunmaker who's been
trying to do this for years.

278
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,860
His name is Norman Stoke.

279
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,940
Is Mr Stoke British?

280
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,420
- Northern Irish.
- Well...

281
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,680
I suppose they count as British,
for now.

282
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,759
Do we know where Mr Stoke is?

283
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,519
Can we get Special Branch
to scoop him up?

284
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,759
He's been on the run since
the Stockholm assassination in 2018.

285
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,680
- How unfortunate.
- But I have an asset.

286
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,279
I know I can find him.

287
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,239
What good would that do us?

288
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,839
Oh, well, gunmaker makes gun.

289
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,079
Gunmaker sells gun to assassin.

290
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,320
- Highly speculative.
- It is a lead, however.

291
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,800
And, to be frank,
we don't have many of those.

292
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:19,735
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

293
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,100
Bianca. A moment, please.

294
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,959
It's always flattering
when the Germans come asking

295
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,180
for our expertise.

296
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,239
Although it would be
a little embarrassing

297
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,620
if the gunmaker turns out
to be British.

298
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,420
Who exactly is this Norman Stoke?

299
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,359
Stoke started making machine-guns
for loyalist paramilitaries

300
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,140
back in the '80s in East Belfast.

301
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,280
Norman and his brother Larry,
killed more than a dozen

302
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,199
innocent Catholic civilians.

303
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,519
Larry was eventually caught
and went to prison

304
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,780
but was released
under the peace agreement.

305
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,919
Er, he's now an enforcer
for a gang of drug dealers.

306
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,959
Norman, meanwhile, perfected his craft

307
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,640
and made the gun used
in the Stockholm assassination.

308
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,200
How would you go about
finding Norman Stoke?

309
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,500
I have an asset in Belfast.

310
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,540
Codename Sparrow.

311
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,900
I've heard good things
about you, Bianca.

312
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:41,860
Don't let me down.

313
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,060
Yeah.

314
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,220
<i>You look like you're at an airport.</i>

316
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,680
- Yeah, sorry.
- <i>But what about parents' evening?</i>

317
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,920
So, I'm assuming you're not coming?

318
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,999
<i>It's a last-minute thing.</i>

319
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,360
You know, she's really
worked her socks off this term.

320
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,719
I know, I know. I feel awful about
it. There was nothing I could do.

321
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,759
Well, you could try
telling her yourself?

322
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,479
Paul, I can't, I can't.
I-I've just got to Belfast

323
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
and I'm-I'm already late for a meeting.

324
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,119
- Right, OK.
- <i>Can you do it, please?</i>

325
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,199
- OK.
- Look, I will try my best

326
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,337
to get on the last flight.

327
00:36:58,362 --> 00:36:59,253
- OK.
<i>- OK?</i>

328
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,759
- I'm sorry.
- Alright, bye, bye.

329
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
OK, bye.

330
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:58,780
When I saw your number,
I almost had a stroke.

331
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,079
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

332
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,140
It has been a long time.

333
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,700
How've you been?

334
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:12,040
- What do you want, Nadine?
- How's the family?

335
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,039
Leave my family out of it.

336
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,000
If Larry knew who I was talking to,
he'd kill me.

337
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,335
<i>There you go. Thanks ever so much.</i>

338
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,079
<i>Do come back and see us.</i>

339
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,540
<i>Have a good day.</i>

340
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,559
But you're being careful?

341
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,420
You remember the protocols?

342
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:34,260
- Yes.
- Good.

343
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,660
Then there's nothing
for you to worry about.

344
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,179
When was the last time Larry
spoke to his brother Norman?

345
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,980
Not since he disappeared.

346
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,700
Are you telling me the truth, Alison?

347
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,040
I know the brothers are close
and I need to find Norman now.

348
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,060
Not my problem.

349
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,439
It's very much your problem,

350
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,720
because if you don't help me
find Norman,

351
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:12,980
you'll go back to prison.

352
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,719
Are you married?

353
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,400
- No.
- Children?

354
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,840
- Nope.
- Career woman.

355
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
It's written all over you.

356
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,960
If you had a husband, you'd know
men have their little secrets.

357
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,400
Well, this is a little secret
I want in on.

358
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,700
I need you to find out
where Norman is... today.

359
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,120
I can't just ask Larry out the blue.

360
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,680
He'll be suspicious.
I'd have to work up to it.

361
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,240
You've got my number.

362
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:01,740
I expect to hear from you tonight.

363
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,220
Can I go now?

364
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,300
It's a free country.

365
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,507
<i>This is Alison. Leave a message.</i>

366
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,119
Alison, it's Nadine.

367
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,500
I haven't heard from you
and I'm very disappointed. Call me.

368
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:03,740
Nadine?

369
00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:08,799
Oh, office in-joke.

370
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,520
Look, baby, I'm so sorry.

371
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,000
You know, about parents' evening.
I really am.

372
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:00,300
Don't turn around.

373
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:06,060
Did you come alone?

374
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,360
Yes, I followed
your instructions to the letter.

375
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,260
Who's the target?

376
00:45:18,353 --> 00:45:21,513
Ulle Dag Charles. UDC.

377
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,380
Can you get to him?

378
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,140
It'll cost.

379
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,999
I mentioned a guide price
of ten million dollars.

380
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,199
Multiply that by ten and then
perhaps we can have a conversation.

381
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,800
That's a very expensive conversation.

382
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,519
Half on commission, half on completion.

383
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,300
All reasonable expenses paid.

384
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,540
Well, I'd have to consult
my colleagues about that.

385
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,300
Hello?

386
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,359
Alison, it's Nadine. You were
supposed to call me last night.

387
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,900
I need to hear from you.

388
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:12,575
Er, get me everything we have
on Alison's daughter, Emma.

389
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
- Copy.
- Yeah?

390
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:14,762
Yeah, yeah. On it.

391
00:46:19,206 --> 00:46:21,620
The BND believe, er...

392
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:28,415
The BND believe our sniper
thought he'd find Manfred

393
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,359
at the Fest Und Fest Unternehmen
offices the night before.

394
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,140
But Manfred wasn't there
so he shot his son, Elias.

395
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:37,820
Manfred was always the real target.

396
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,239
Elias was used as bait
to lure Manfred to the hospital.

397
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,359
That would take a lot of pre-planning.

398
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,700
Well, all planning is pre.

399
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,719
How did Belfast go?

400
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,519
My asset isn't cooperating.

401
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,900
I think we have to get
creative on this one.

402
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,060
She has a daughter, Emma.

403
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,240
A student in London.

404
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,999
Involved in a radical leftist group.

405
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,380
I think I can see where
you're going with this.

406
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:10,279
We have to be very careful

407
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,820
about sanctioning
this kind of operation.

408
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,839
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

409
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,839
- What do we want?!
- The truth about money!

410
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,039
- When do we want it?
- Now!

411
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,720
UDC! UDC! UDC!

412
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,959
River's here to make it clear!

413
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,959
You can't wash your money here!

414
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,800
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

415
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,799
Yep, that's her in the pink scarf.

416
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,999
Do I have to wait for her to act up?

417
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
No. Just go get her.

418
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:47,900
Fine by me.

419
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,479
Miss, you're causing
an obstruction in a public highway.

420
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,119
If you do not get up and move
right now, you're liable for arrest.

421
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,319
Why don't you go
and do something useful

422
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,380
like arrest the fat cats...

423
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,319
<i>You can't wash your money here!</i>

424
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,639
- I'm not threatening you, miss.
- Well, OK, well you should try

425
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,960
being where I am...

426
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,239
That's a threat. It's a threat to me.

427
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,679
I'm being reasonable.
I'm not raising my voice

428
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,160
in the way that you are.

429
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,800
I don't care about your law,
I don't care!

430
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
Right, that's enough.
Have 'em up. Thank you!

431
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,479
Get your hands off me, lackey!

432
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,720
- Whose streets?!
- Our streets!

433
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:52,920
- Whose streets?!
- Our streets!

434
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,119
- Whose streets?!
- Our streets!

435
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,319
You're in very serious trouble, Emma.

436
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,620
You're in very serious trouble.

437
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,199
We have four witnesses who saw you

438
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,959
throw the bottle at the police officer.

439
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,440
We got four...

440
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,200
witnesses who saw you throw the bottle
at the police officer.

441
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,300
What bottle?

442
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,540
What are you talking about?
Nobody was throwing anything.

443
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,100
You didn't even ask about the officer.

444
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,376
- She was badly hurt.
- I didn't throw any bottle.

445
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,079
The officer's gonna lose her right eye.

446
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,640
She's gonna lose her right eye,
since you didn't ask.

447
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,620
Just a young woman,

448
00:49:41,026 --> 00:49:42,546
doing her job.

449
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,880
How's that make you feel, Emma?

450
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,860
You're making this up.

451
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,860
So fuck right off.

452
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,280
And I want a solicitor.

453
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,800
I have a right to a solicitor.

454
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,360
You can call your mother.

455
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,060
You can call your mother.

456
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:23,580
This way, please.

457
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,559
- Fuck off me!
- Get in there.

458
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,000
Where's my solicitor?!

459
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,720
Where's my solicitor?! This is illegal!

460
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,520
Oh, my God!

461
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,745
I wasn't expecting you until next week.

462
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,439
What and miss Carlito's birthday?
Not happening.

463
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,959
- Talk to me.
- She was like this when I found her.

464
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,640
She's still alive.
I've called the paramedics.

465
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,079
"At the tone,
please record your message."

466
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,780
Bianca,

467
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,660
we've got a serious problem
with your student.

468
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:05,240
- What the fuck is going on?
- She collapsed.

469
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,679
They think it's a cardiac issue.
They've stabilised her.

470
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,559
They think she's gonna make it.

471
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,520
I'm the accompanying officer.

472
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,140
Emma. Hang on, OK?

473
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,349
You're gonna be alright.

474
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,779
♪ Underneath It All

475
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,860

480
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,380
What's happening?

481
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,900
